# wlan10

wlan10 is a Wi-Fi network manager for Windows. It allows users to set the preferred connection order of Wi-Fi networks, so that your computer will always connect to the Wi-Fi you prefer when multiple networks are available.

This functionality was available in older versions of Windows, but was removed in Windows 10. wlan10 exists to fill this gap, without the need for users to hack around with the command-line `netsh` commands.

## Requirements

* Windows 10 or 8.1
* .NET 4 or newer
* A PC with Wi-Fi support

## Usage

1. Download wlan10 from [releases](https://github.com/afit/wlan10/releases) and run it.
2. wlan10 will show a list of networks that your computer is configured to automatically connect to.

    wlan10 can't add Wi-Fi networks to your list: you should add new networks by connecting to them through Windows as usual.

3. Drag and drop networks to change the preferred connection order to your liking, and click `Save` to store this new order.

    Windows will now prefer the networks which you put on top, selecting the highest positioned available network.
    
    Setting autoconnect and autoswitching doesn't require saving.  

wlan10 is only required for configuring preferred network connect order: it does not need to remain running in the background, and can even be deleted after use.

> **Note:** What is autoswitching?
>
> The `autoSwitch` (`WLANProfile`) element determines the roaming behavior of an auto-connected network when a more preferred network is in range. This element is optional.
>
> If `autoSwitch` is `true` and `connectionMode` is set to `auto`, a connection to a more preferred network must be attempted whenever a more preferred network comes into range. A more preferred network is one that is ordered higher in the list of preferred wireless networks. This connection attempt occurs when connected to another network.
>
> An `autoSwitch` value set to `true` results in a higher frequency of periodic scanning for new networks. This may result in increased radio frequency pollution from these periodic scans and increased power consumption used by the wireless network adapter.
